# BuddyForStudy Research Plan

## Background of the Project

In universities, students often need help with subjects they find difficult. Peer-to-peer learning is an effective method for knowledge exchange, but finding the right match can be challenging. This project aims to design an application, **"BuddyForStudy,"** that matches students within the same university, enabling those who need help with a specific subject to connect with peers proficient in that subject. The application will facilitate these connections, allowing students to agree on helping requests and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

## Solution and Value

The proposed application, **BuddyForStudy**, will create a streamlined process for matching students seeking help with those willing to provide assistance in specific subjects. By leveraging a user-friendly interface and intelligent matching algorithms, BuddyForStudy will ensure that students find the best possible match based on their needs and preferences. This will not only enhance the learning experience but also build a supportive academic community within the university.

**Value Proposition:**
- **Accessibility:** Makes peer-to-peer learning more accessible.
- **Organization:** Organizes study sessions efficiently.
- **Efficiency:** Contributes to better academic performance.
- **Community Building:** Strengthens student networks.

## Main Research Goals

1. **Understand student needs and behaviors** related to seeking and offering help in academic subjects.
2. **Identify key features and preferences** for an application that matches students for academic assistance.
3. **Evaluate the usability** of the proposed application design and gather feedback for improvements.
