### Questions & Responses:

1. **Have you tried explaining something to someone regarding studying?**  
   No.  

2. **Have you tried asking a student to explain something to you regarding studying?**  
   Yes.  

3. **How do you feel about this experience?**  
   All for it, I'll always look for help if I can.  

4. **How would you evaluate yourself or others for studying help?**  
   For self-evaluation, I usually look for logical links between what I know and if I'm able to put knowledge into habit. I'd use a 1-10 scale if I had to rank.  

5. **What do you usually do when you need help with studying?**  
   I first look for online resources and possible help from students; only otherwise I contact instructors.  

6. **What do you think if there was a tool to connect you to someone who can help you? Would you use it?**  
   Definitely.  

7. **Are there specific preferences which should exist in that person to get help from?**  
   I'm fine with anonymous help, but I'd like to see a metric for their experience if possible.  

8. **If you can rate the person who helped you, based on which metrics would you make your decision?**  
   I'd prefer not to, but if I had to, I'd rate them by the resources they presented.  

9. **How would you prefer to interact with students or platforms offering help?**  
   If there was an app that targeted struggling students, sure, but it shouldn't oblige you to help (like Znanija, where you have to provide some help to reveal answers to other questions).  

10. **Would you like to work with such students long-term (e.g., check if the student mastered the skill they were seeking)?**  
    Probably not. I prefer that there wouldn't be any long-term obligations.  

11. **What platform features would you find helpful for such a tool?**  
    List anonymous topics where students explain what they need help with. Others can anonymously respond, then maybe message privately. Like in Avito.  

12. **How do you see the topics on the main screen?**  
    All topics individually (as in, user-topic pair), or put into categories for knowledge area, kind of topic, etc.  

13. **Would you like to communicate with the matched person in the same app?**  
    Yes.  

14. **Do you prefer a color theme?**  
    Light, but a dark theme is required.  

15. **Do you prefer to see notifications or toggle them off?**  
    Make it customizable.
