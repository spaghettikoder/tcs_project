### Questions & Responses:

1. **Have you tried explaining something to someone regarding studying?**  
   Yes.  

2. **How do you feel about this experience?**  
   Feels good.  

3. **Have you tried asking a student to explain something to you regarding studying?**  
   Yes. I'm all for it.  

4. **How would you evaluate someone who helped you?**  
   I'd use a 1-10 scale.  

5. **What do you usually do when you need help with studying?**  
   I always look for online resources, then maybe help from students.  

6. **What do you think if there was a tool to connect you to someone who can help you? Would you use it?**  
   Definitely.  

7. **Are there specific preferences which should exist in that person to get help from?**  
   I'd like to see some evaluation of their knowledge and their occupation (as in, student or not).  

8. **If you can rate the person who helped you, based on which metrics would you make your decision?**  
   How correct they were, I guess.  

9. **How much effort would you spend on helping others?**  
   Depends on whether I'm available and it's convenient, and whether the student is actually willing to learn.  

10. **Would you like to work with a student long-term (e.g., check if the student mastered the skill they were seeking)?**  
    That also depends on the student. I'd usually prefer not to.  

11. **What platform or method do you think would be helpful for engaging students?**  
    Could as well be a dedicated VK group. If I had to engage students who teach, I see a forum like Znanija helpful.  

12. **What do you think of something peer-to-peer oriented, if a student seeks someone to help with a subject?**  
    I think there's enough resources online for that already. If some student also wants someone else to keep them accountable, they're likely procrastinating, so they may as well find any convenient study buddy, maybe a neighbor.  

13. **Do you think thereâ€™s a solution for someone who has no one in proximity?**  
    I could be wrong, but don't think that is a problem related to studying skills. This is as convenient as I imagine it.
